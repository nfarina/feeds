/// Returns a string that is escaped properly to be a URL argument.

/// This differs from stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding: in that it

/// stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding would leave.

/// This will also escape '%', so this should not be used on a string that has
/// already been escaped unless double-escaping is the desired result.

/// Returns the unescaped version of a URL argument
//
/// This has the same behavior as stringByReplacingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:,
